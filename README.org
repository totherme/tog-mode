* tog-mode

Tiny emacs minor mode for toggling between multiple major modes.

To use, place =tog-mode.el= in your load-path, and run:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'tog-mode)
#+end_src

You can now call =tog-setup= with a list of modes you wish to toggle
between. For example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(tog-setup (list 'latex-mode 'org-mode))
#+end_src

This will give you the keyboard shortcut =C-c #= to toggle between the
major modes you listed.
